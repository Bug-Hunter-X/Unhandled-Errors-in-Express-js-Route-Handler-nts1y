# Express.js Unhandled Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to handle database errors or cases where a requested user does not exist.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (assuming you have a `package.json` with Express.js).
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Observe the lack of informative error messages for database errors or missing users.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version with improved error handling.

## Key improvements in the solution

- Explicit error handling for database errors.
- Proper handling of 404 (Not Found) errors when a user does not exist.
- More informative error messages for better debugging and user experience.
